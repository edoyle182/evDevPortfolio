      <p class="aboutEvan">
        Daily I found myself exploring ways to make my work environment, my coworkers, and myself more efficient regarding veterinary medicine.  Dissecting technologies, techniques, and processes to comprehend their purpose and utmost capability enabled me to maximize their efficiency, as well as my own. This curiosity led me to innovate around persistent flaws, creating better processes and techniques with whatever experiential or educational resource I had acquired.
        <br>
        <br>
        A persistent flaw of my own occurred with this: My inability to write and develop my ideas into applications or technologies road-blocked many of my ideas. I have since dedicated my time to learning development.
